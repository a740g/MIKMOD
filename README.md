# MIKMOD

MikMod 2.10 with my Sound Blaster 32/AWE32/AWE64 driver (https://github.com/a740g/MIKMOD/blob/main/source/drv_awe.c)

This is only here for legacy and historical reasons. MikMod 2.10 source is included here for completeness. For more information on the rest of MikMod 2.10 source code, read https://github.com/a740g/MIKMOD/blob/main/mikmod.txt

If you want to use and compile it, then use [Open Watcom](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases) or [DJGPP](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html).

You can do with this whatever you please. As usual, I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk. Have fun.
